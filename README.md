## What is Buffalo Transit

Buffalo transit is an information app designed to make the Niagra Falls, Buffalo, and University at Buffalo shuttle transit systems more user friendly. At present, information on what buses will stop at a given stop is accessible only by checking each bus route for the presence of that stop. Buffalo Transit solves this issue by displaying information by stop and by bus line, as well as graphically. This makes planning routes much simpler for the end user. My long term goals are to include routing functionality which can incorporate both NFTA and UB shuttle.

## Stack
- nodejs
- React Native
- Expo

## How to get started

To install expo:

in the project directory: 
- `npm install expo`
- `npx expo install expo-dev-client`

## To run the project: 

**Web**: 
`npx expo start --web`

**Android:**

To run the project you must first install android studio, and either the emulator tools or connect your android phone. 
- `npx expo run:android`
**IOS:**

I haven't done this; I think that you need to be running xcode to push apps to your phone or to use apple's emulator. However, if you have those, try
- `npx expo run:ios`
